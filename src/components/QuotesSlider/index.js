      From start to fruition, Joe was available every step of the way – having
      time to chat through the development, and full transparency of the build
      through GitHub gave me and my stakeholders great confidence.

      <br />
      Yalla worked flexibly with our budget and timescale for the Tech for Good
      project we’d asked them to help us with. Their strong team management also
      helped us feel we were able to give feedback quickly, and feel really
      involved in the process. As Joe and Simon are also Founders and Coders
      grads, I also felt they had a strong sense of product development from
      both a UX and technical point of view.
      <br />
      <br />
      Above all, Yalla held similar values to our organisation – an interest in
      social impact projects, and driven by value for users. I would not
      hesitate to work with them again.
