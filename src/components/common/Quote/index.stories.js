      I’ve been working with Yalla for six months and the word I would use to
      describe them best is ‘reliable.’ At first I was concerned about hiring
      Yalla because the ‘remote’ development aspect made me feel like I wouldn’t
      have the closeness I felt I needed, especially as a virgin founder with
      zero product experience. But Yalla made me feel in control and included
      from day 1 by being well structured, reliable and honest.

      Despite my demanding a lot from Yalla in terms of quality ​and​ quantity
      of work, they have given me precisely what I dreamt about building and
      they’ve done it fast, too. Thanks to Yalla, I’ve been able to realise my
      product vision with a robust MVP and I’m well on the way to achieving my
      impact goals.

      I would highly recommend Yalla if you’ve got a product vision and are
      looking for real, trustworthy and hardworking people to accompany you
      along the way.&quot;
