Here's a video explaining that problem they're looking to solve:

earwig had carried out extensive user research and testing of initial design prototypes, so we first ran workshops to do a user and design audit, assessing what stage of the process they were at to agree the most efficient way for us to work with them.

This involved breaking down every user and user journey, prioritising to ensure we can deliver the quickest prototype to take back for further testing.
